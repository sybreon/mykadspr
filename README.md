SPR MyKAD Checker
=================

This script helps to automate checking of MyKAD numbers against the
SPR voter database. It takes a "mykad.csv" input file of MyKAD numbers
and outputs a "result.csv" file of responses.

This script is released under GPLv3.

How to Use
----------

1. Create a text file "mykad.csv" with I/C numbers (without dashes). One I/C number per line.
2. Place the file in the same directory as the Python script.
3. Run "python mykadspr.py"
4. Wait...
5. Open the results from "result.csv"
